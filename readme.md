What it is

### Method

Purpose of how it do what it do

### Challenges

The purpose of this project is to put what I've learned recently into practice. 

- A thing
- Another thing

### Limitations

At present this page can't handle all punctuation. Given that making it work would be rote and repititous labor, and this project is meant to practice new skills rather than provide a functional product, I don't think getting this working would be important.
