			You have arrived at the porcine capitol of Omeray, where you intend to bring a petition to the enatesay about the corrupt ublicanpays which are squeezing your country dry with unreasonable taxes. However, the pig people are notoriously offended by any language other than their own. No one will listen to you unless you can master saying what you wish to say in the enigmatic tongue of "Pig Latin." Fortunately, you have heard of someone you may be willing to help you...

			If I have done my work properly, the two Pig Latin translators below should look and function identically, with the only difference between them being that one is coded without using Regular Expressions at all, and the other is coded with as many Regular Expressions as I could fit into it.
